# Sudoku
Sudoku game and solver in one. Backtracking algorithm using pygame.

There is a console version of sudoku backtracking algorithm (sudoku.py) - just a solver. 

Second attempt was to create GUI with help of pygame. It is possible to play as well as to see how the backtracking algorithm works in practice.
